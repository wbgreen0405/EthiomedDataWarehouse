# For FastAPI application
fastapi
uvicorn
python-dotenv       # For loading environment variables from .env
sqlalchemy          # For database ORM (used in app/database.py)
psycopg2-binary     # PostgreSQL adapter for SQLAlchemy (crucial for your DB connection)
Jinja2              # For templating (used in app/main.py)
python-multipart    # For handling form data in FastAPI
# If you use pydantic's v2 features, you might need:
# pydantic>=2.0.0
# pydantic-settings # If you move settings to Pydantic-settings

# For YOLOv5 (minimal requirements for running train/detect scripts)
# These are the ones usually installed directly by YOLOv5's own requirements.txt,
# but it's good to list core ones your project directly relies on if you aren't
# running 'pip install -r yolov5/requirements.txt' as a separate step.
# Note: train_model.py already attempts to install yolov5/requirements.txt
torch
torchvision
ultralytics # YOLOv5 is from Ultralytics
pillow      # For image processing in various libraries
psutil      # For system info, often a YOLOv5 dependency
PyYAML      # For YAML parsing, used by YOLOv5 and its configs
requests    # For HTTP requests, used by Roboflow and others
tqdm        # For progress bars

# For Roboflow dataset download and inference
roboflow
inference-sdk # For Roboflow InferenceHTTPClient

# For MediaPipe (if used in FastAPI for face ROI extraction)
mediapipe
opencv-python # Used by MediaPipe and general image processing

# For asynchronous operations (if nest_asyncio is still explicitly used)
nest-asyncio
